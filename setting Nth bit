  scanf("%d",&number);
  
  printf("enter the position\n") ;
  scanf("%d",&position);
  
  mask=(1<<position);               //shifting 1 to given position
  
  number=mask | number;             // bit wise or it to set that particuler bit and store it to original number 
  
  printf("the read number is changed to %d after setting its %d",number,position);   //changes after setting a NTH bit

}

OUTPUT:
enter the number
7
enter the position
3
the read number is changed to 15 after setting its bit at position 3
