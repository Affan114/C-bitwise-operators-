            // C program to toggle nth bit of given number
            
            
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) 
{
  int number,position,mask;
  
  printf("enter the number\n") ; 
  scanf("%d",&number);
  
  printf("enter the position\n") ;
  scanf("%d",&position);
  
  mask=(1<<position);
  
  number=(mask ^ number);                         // ^ is used to toggle  if 0 is present then make it 1 if 1 is present make it 0 .this is toggling mechanism
  
  printf("the read number is changed to %d after toggling  its bit at position %d  ",number,position); 
  
  return 0;
}

OUTPUT:
enter the number
9                                           
enter the position
3                                           
the read number is changed to 1 after toggling  its bit at position 3
